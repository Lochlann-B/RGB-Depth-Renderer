# Real-time Reconstruction and Rendering of RGB+Depth Video Scenes

Dissertation project for CST part II.

A modified implementation and evaluation of geometry reconstruction methods from [this](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478513.3480490) paper by Google, for more general-use scenarios.

A video demonstrating the input process and final outputs can be found [here](https://lochlann-b.github.io/RGBD-Reconstruction/).

Input data has not been added to this repository due to its large size; producing your own inputs and modifying the code to use them would be tedious, so think of this repo as a demonstration of my work, and not as an actual product.
